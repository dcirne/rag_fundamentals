  The material in this repository was initially prepared for
  a lecture I gave at The 2024 IARIA Annual Congress on
  Frontiers in Science, Technology, Services, and
  Applications, on the topics of Retrieval-Augmented
  Generation (RAG) and Semantic Chunking.


  RAG is a technique used to optimize the output of a Large
  Language Model (LLM). The expectation is that In-Context
  Learning (ICL) takes place, leading the LLM to produce
  better results.


  RAG can be more effective when semantic chunking is used.
  The basic idea is to retrieve and compile small "chunks"
  of data to augment the prompt to be sent to an LLM, rather
  than inserting entire documents that contain the topic of
  interest, but also information that is not relevant to the
  user interaction.
